# 📍 AWA Project - Current Status

**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Branch**: main  
**Status**: Cleaned up and refocused ✅

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS FIXED TODAY

### 1. **Routing Bug - CRITICAL FIX** 🔴→🟢
**Problem**: Onboarding screen was routing Full Experience to `/setup/profile` (CoreProfileWizard), which **bypassed the entire existing flow** (photo/tinder/dna/ladder/surveys).

**Solution**: Fixed `OnboardingScreen.tsx` line 51:
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG):
router.push('/setup/profile');  // ← skipped all questions!

// AFTER (CORRECT):
router.push('/flow/photo');  // ← continues with full flow
```

**Impact**: Full Experience now uses **ALL existing questions** as intended!

---

### 2. **Dashboard Access** 🎯
**Problem**: No way to access dashboard after logging in.

**Solution**: Added dashboard button (top-right) on landing page for logged-in users.

**File**: `LandingScreen.tsx`

---

### 3. **Documentation Cleanup** 📚
**Problem**: 3 overlapping documentation files creating confusion.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Moved old docs to `/docs/archive/`
- ✅ Created single source of truth: `docs/MASTER_PLAN.md`
- ✅ Created this status file: `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md`

---

## 🎯 CURRENT FLOW (WORKING)

### Full Experience Path:
```
Landing
  → Onboarding (consent + demographics)
  → Photo Upload (✅ FIXED ROUTING!)
  → Tinder (33 images, behavioral tracking) 
  → DNA Analysis
  → Ladder (conversational needs)
  → Survey 1 (PRS pre-test)
  → Survey 2 (explicit preferences)
  → [TODO: Persona Report]
  → Generate (FLUX)
  → Thanks (PRS post-test)
```

**Time**: 15-20 minutes  
**Generations**: Unlimited  
**ALL questions preserved** ✅

### Fast Track Path:
```
Landing
  → Fast Track (quick intro)
  → Photo Upload
  → Quick Tinder (10 swipes)
  → Generate (10x limit)
```

**Time**: 3-5 minutes  
**Generations**: 10 (then upgrade prompt)

## 🗂️ FILE STATUS

### ✅ WORKING (don't touch!)
- `/flow/onboarding` → `/flow/photo` → full flow ✅
- `/flow/photo`, `/flow/tinder`, `/flow/dna`, `/flow/ladder`
- `/flow/survey1`, `/flow/survey2`, `/flow/generate`, `/flow/thanks`
- `components/screens/*` - All working screens
- `components/ui/*` - Glass design system
- `components/awa/*` - 3D model + dialogue

### ⏸️ FUTURE FEATURES (exist but unused)
These files were created for **multi-room architecture** but are NOT connected to current flow:

- `components/wizards/CoreProfileWizard.tsx` - Duplicate of existing flow (not needed)
- `components/setup/HouseholdSetup.tsx` - For returning users (later)
- `components/setup/RoomSetup.tsx` - For multi-room support (later)
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Exists but needs polish
- `components/research/*` - Some components with emojis (needs cleanup)

**Why not used?**
- Focus on perfecting **single-room flow** first
- Validate research methodology
- Collect pilot data
- THEN add multi-room complexity

---

## 📋 NEXT PRIORITIES

### Immediate (This Week):
1. **Test end-to-end flow** - Make sure full experience works from start to finish
2. **Remove emojis** from any new components (violates design system)
3. **Create Persona Report page** (`/flow/persona`) - The "16 Personalities" moment between Survey 2 and Generate

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks):
1. Implement Fast Track properly
2. Polish Dashboard for returning users
3. Test with pilot users

### Long-term (Later):
1. Multi-room architecture (use existing setup components)
2. Household management
3. Session history

## 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM RULES

### ✅ DO:
- Use `GlassCard`, `GlassButton`, `GlassSurface`
- Pearl/Platinum/Silver/Gold/Champagne colors
- Nasalization (headers) + Modern (body)
- Glassmorphism effects
- Smooth animations (Framer Motion)
- Lucide icons with glass backgrounds

### ❌ DON'T:
- **NO EMOJIS** (👎 breaks minimalist aesthetic)
- **NO COLORFUL ICONS** (🌈 not our style)
- No busy layouts
- No inconsistent spacing

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

Before pilot:
- [ ] Test Full Experience end-to-end (Landing → Thanks)
- [ ] Test Fast Track (Landing → Generate with 10x limit)
- [ ] Verify all data saves to Supabase
- [ ] Check 3D model renders correctly on all pages
- [ ] Test on mobile (responsive design)
- [ ] Remove any remaining emojis in UI

## 💡 KEY INSIGHT

**The Problem We Solved Today:**

I accidentally created a **duplicate flow** (CoreProfileWizard) that was routing users AWAY from the existing, working flow. This bypassed all your carefully designed questions!

**The Solution:**

Keep it simple - use the **existing flow** that already works. The new architecture (multi-room, dashboard, etc.) is great for the FUTURE, but not needed for the core experience right now.

**Focus**: Perfect the single-room, full-depth psychological profiling flow first. Get pilot data. THEN add complexity.
