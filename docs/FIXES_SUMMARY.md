# 🔧 Fixes Applied - October 21, 2025

## ✅ CRITICAL BUGS FIXED

### 1. **Tinder Swipes in CoreProfileWizard** ✅
**Problem**: Dragging didn't work properly, buttons not always clickable

**Fixed**:
- ✅ Added `whileDrag={{ scale: 1.05, rotate: 5 }}` - animated drag
- ✅ Added `style={{ touchAction: 'none' }}` - better touch handling
- ✅ Added `draggable={false}` on Image - prevent browser conflicts
- ✅ Changed `AnimatePresence mode="wait"` → no mode (smoother)
- ✅ Added `z-10` to buttons - always clickable above card
- ✅ Matched working implementation from `/flow/tinder/page.tsx`

### 2. **Unclickable Buttons Throughout** ✅
**Problem**: Many buttons missing `glass-panel` class, inconsistent styling

**Fixed Components**:
- ✅ `OnboardingScreen.tsx` - Age Range, Gender, Education
- ✅ `CoreProfileWizard.tsx` - All lifecycle steps
  - Living Situation
  - Life Vibe
  - Goals
  - Materials
  - Color Palettes
  - Feelings
  - Rituals
  
**Changes**:
- Added `glass-panel` to all buttons
- Changed `bg-white/10` → `glass-panel` + proper border
- Selected state: `border-2 border-gold bg-gold/10`
- Hover state: `border border-white/30 hover:border-gold/50`

### 3. **Button Consistency** ✅
**Problem**: Arrows not centered with text

**Fixed**: Updated `GlassButton.tsx`:
```tsx
// Added to button className:
'flex items-center justify-center gap-2'
```

Now all arrows are vertically centered with text automatically.

### 4. **Card Heights Jumping** ✅
**Problem**: Different heights on each step causing layout shifts

**Fixed**: Added `min-h-[600px]` to all GlassCards in CoreProfileWizard:
- LifestyleStep
- TinderSwipesStep (instructions)
- SemanticDifferentialStep
- ColorsMaterialsStep
- AspirationalSelfStep
- PRS Ideal step
- All other wizard steps

### 5. **MoodGrid Layout** ✅
**Problem**: Labels in wrong places, grid not centered

**Fixed**:
- Added `max-w-[500px] mx-auto` to container
- Fixed X-axis labels with proper `writingMode: 'vertical-rl'` and `vertical-lr`
- Changed label colors to `text-graphite font-semibold`
- Added proper spacing (mb-3, mt-3)
- Centered grid with `justify-center`
- Fixed width allocations (w-20 for side labels)

### 6. **Dashboard Visual Issues** ✅
**Problem**: Colorful icons (blue, pink, purple), IDA covered, different heights

**Fixed**:
- ✅ Changed all colored gradients → `from-gold to-champagne` only
- ✅ Added `pb-32` to main content div - IDA not covered anymore
- ✅ Removed: `blue-400 to-cyan-500`, `purple-400 to-pink-500`
- ✅ Now only gold/champagne throughout (consistent with design system)

### 7. **Profile Access After Login** ✅
**Problem**: Dashboard button linked to non-existent `/setup/profile/edit`

**Fixed**:
- Changed `handleEditProfile` → routes to `/setup/profile` (exists)
- Dashboard "Profil" button now works correctly

### 8. **Emoji Removal** ✅
**Problem**: Emojis throughout new components (breaks minimalist design)

**Removed from**:
- ✅ `OnboardingScreen.tsx` - Gender buttons (👩👨🧑✨)
- ✅ `CoreProfileWizard.tsx` - ALL emojis:
  - Living situation (🧘💑👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🏠)
  - Goals (🧘‍♀️🎨💼❤️🔒✨)
  - Feelings (🧘⚡🎨🎯❤️🌿)
  - Rituals (☕📚🧘‍♀️💻👨‍👩‍👧🎨)
  - Materials (🪵⚙️🧶🪨🪟👜)
- ✅ `HouseholdSetup.tsx` - ALL emojis
- ✅ `RoomSetup.tsx` - ALL emojis

**Replaced with**: Clean text labels with `font-semibold` styling

### 9. **SensoryTests Height Consistency** ✅
**Problem**: Different card heights due to varying description lengths

**Fixed**:
- Added `min-h-[280px] flex flex-col` to option cards
- Added `flex-1 flex flex-col` to content area
- All cards now same height regardless of text length
